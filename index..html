            <h1>Hello there</h1>
            <p>"Faces" is an episode of the American science fiction television series Star Trek: Voyager. First broadcast by UPN in May 1995, it was developed from a story by Jonathan Glassner and Kenneth Biller. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the starship USS Voyager after they are stranded in the Delta Quadrant, far from the rest of the Federation. In this episode, a Vidiian scientist named Sulan (Brian Markinson) captures and performs medical experiments on the half-Klingon, half-human B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson). He creates two clones, human Torres and Klingon Torres, to serve as test subjects; these were treated as two separate characters during the development and filming of the episode. The episode was developed as a character study to further explore Torres' internal struggle with her identity. Dawson (pictured) said that it deepened her understanding of the character and strengthened her acting. </p>
